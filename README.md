Photostat
=========

I needed a command-line utility for managing my own photo collection.
I'm tired of graphical UIs that suck.

Project may include an embedded web server / web interface for managing tags and such,
but I might just synchronize with Flickr.

For now only the basics are covered:

* building a local repository of photos organized in %Y-%m sub-directories
* synchronizing photos with Flickr
* I might switch to Picassa
